The file `Milk_Composition.csv` is available on the class Moodle site (Real Data!). This file contains the composition of milk for a collection of mammals. The variables measured are the compositions (as a percentage) of five milk constituents: Water, Protein, Fat, Lactose, and Ash. (Ash is a term used to describe inorganic residue from the incineration of organic matter and is mostly minerals).

Read this table into R and create the object Mammals_Milk using

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
Mammals_Milk<-read.csv("Milk_Composition.csv",header=T,row.names=1)
```

# Question 1
Use the summary function to produce a summary of the variables (mean, median..) in the Mammals_Milk data frame.
```{r}
Mammals_Milk %>% summary()
```

To have comparable units, let's standardize values (z-scores) of the five variables: Water, Protein, Fat, Lactose, and Ash using the scale function and store it as an object `Mammals_Milk_Std`. A 0 z-score means an observation is right on its mean; a negative value means it's smaller than mean; a larger number means it's larger than the mean.
```{r}
Mammals_Milk_Std<-round(scale(Mammals_Milk),2)
head(Mammals_Milk_Std)
```
# Question 2
Use hierarchical clustering (i.e. `hclust`) to cluster the animals based on the standardized composition of their milk. Use the Euclidean metric and complete linkage. Plot the dendrogram of the clustering. In your dendrogram: 

*	Set the line width to 3
*	Set the title to “Mammals Clustered by Std. Milk Composition \n Euclidean Metric, Complete Linkage”
*	Remove the subtitle by setting sub= ""
*	Set the x-axis label to “Mammals” with cex.lab=1.25
*	Have the terminal edges extend to the 0 height by setting hang=-1
*	Set the frame.plot argument to T to draw a box around the dendrograms

```{r}
Mammals_Milk_HC<-hclust(dist(Mammals_Milk_Std))
plot(Mammals_Milk_HC,lwd=3,sub="",hang=-1,xlab="Mammals",cex.lab=1.25,
 main="Mammals Clustered by Std. Milk Composition \n Euclidean Metric, Complete Linkage",
 frame.plot=T)

```

# Question 3
For k = 3 and k = 4, perform a k-means clustering of the mammals based on their standardized milk composition. Before clustering, set the seed to 125, which I already copied below for you at the beginning of the cell. This is for me to be able to perfectly replicate your potentially different clustering solution (it's a stochastic/random process remember>?) Set the nstart option to 100. Call the kmeans objects `MMilk_km_3` and `MMilk_km_4.` Append the clustering solutions (i.e. the cluster membership vectors) on the right side of the original data frame, naming the columns `km_3` and `km_4.` Use the arrange function to sort this table on the cluster membership columns, first for `km_3` and a second time for `km_4.` Print both sorted tables in your solutions here, one for the K = 3 solution sorting and a second one for the K = 4 cluster solution sorting.
```{r}
set.seed(125)
MMilk_km_3<-kmeans(Mammals_Milk_Std,centers=3,nstart=100)
MMilk_km_4<-kmeans(Mammals_Milk_Std,centers=4,nstart=100)
Mammals_Milk<-data.frame(Mammals_Milk,km_3=MMilk_km_3$cluster,km_4=MMilk_km_4$cluster)
Mammals_Milk %>% arrange(km_3)
Mammals_Milk %>% arrange(km_4)
```

Use the `group_by` and `summarize` functions to provide tables summarizing the results of the two different cluster solutions (K = 3 and K = 4) above. Make one table for each of the clustering procedures. Include in the table the values

*	`Count`: the group size
*	`Mean_Water` the mean water content
*	`Mean_Protein` the mean protein content
*	`Mean_Fat` the mean fat content
*	`Mean_Lactose` the mean lactose content
*	`Mean_Ash` the mean ash content

Call the summary tables `MMilk_Agg_K3` and `MMilk_Agg_K4`. Round the elements in the data frames to the hundredths place and paste them into your solutions.

```{r}
MMilk_Agg_K3<-Mammals_Milk %>% 
            group_by(km_3) %>% 
            summarize(Count=n(),Mean_Water=mean(Water),Mean_Protein=mean(Protein), Mean_Fat=mean(Fat),Mean_Lactose=mean(Lactose),Mean_Ash=mean(Ash)) %>% 
            round(2)
MMilk_Agg_K3

MMilk_Agg_K4<-Mammals_Milk %>%
group_by(km_4) %>%
summarize(Count=n(),Mean_Water=mean(Water),Mean_Protein=mean(Protein),
Mean_Fat=mean(Fat),Mean_Lactose=mean(Lactose),Mean_Ash=mean(Ash)) %>% 
        round(2)
MMilk_Agg_K4

```
# Question 4
For the K=3 solution, make a set of boxplots showing the distribution of each variable by cluster membership. In total you should have five graphs (one for each variable in the dataset). Each graph should include three boxplots (one for each cluster). *Hint:* Use `ggplot2` with `geom_boxplot` and 

```{r}
require(cowplot)
graph1 <- ggplot(Mammals_Milk, aes(x=factor(km_3), y=Water)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
graph2 <- ggplot(Mammals_Milk, aes(x=factor(km_3), y=Protein)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
graph3 <- ggplot(Mammals_Milk, aes(x=factor(km_3), y=Fat)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
graph4 <- ggplot(Mammals_Milk, aes(x=factor(km_3), y=Lactose)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
graph5 <- ggplot(Mammals_Milk, aes(x=factor(km_3), y=Ash)) + 
    geom_boxplot()

plot_grid(graph1, graph2, graph3, graph4, graph5, labels = "AUTO")
```

# Question 5
Create a plot showing how WGSS changes for K = 1 to 8 groups. For each K choice, cluster the mammals based on their standardized milk composition and set the nstart argument to run at 50 at each iteration. Compute and record WGSS. After the loop is done, show the plot of WGSS by the number of clusters in your solutions. How many clusters does the elbow plot suggest? How does this compare to your impression from the dendrogram in Question 2?
```{r}
#theme_set(theme_classic()) # you can change default ggplot2 themes--see more: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html

wgss<-rep(0,8)
for(i in 1:8){
wgss[i]<-kmeans(Mammals_Milk_Std,centers=i,nstart=50)$tot.withinss
}


ggplot(as.data.frame(wgss), aes(x=1:8,y=wgss)) + geom_point(size=2) + geom_line(linetype = "dashed")
#plot(c(1:8),wgss,type="b",pch=16,cex=1.3,ylim=c(0,150),xlab="Number of Groups", ylab="WGSS")
```
The elbow plot would seem to suggest 4 clusters is the best solution, as the rate of decline of WGSS falls off at that point. The 4-cluster solution also appears to be supported by the dendrogram created in part iii, where cutting the dendrogram at a height of approximately 3 appears to generate 4 clusters with significant separation from each other that also exhibit internal cohesion.
